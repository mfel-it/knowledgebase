# USB Knowledge test

**Basics and Standards**
* Explain what the acronym USB stands for and its primary purpose.
* List the different major USB versions (e.g., USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, USB4) and a key distinguishing feature of each.
* Describe the physical differences between USB Type-A, Type-B, and Type-C connectors.
* What are the typical maximum data transfer speeds supported by USB 2.0 and USB 3.2 Gen 2?

**Practical Implications**
* Discuss the concept of backwards compatibility within USB standards.
* You're connecting an external hard drive designed for USB 3.0 to a USB 2.0 port. Explain the functional implications of this.
* What is the benefit of USB-C's reversible connector design?
* How does USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) change the way devices can be powered through USB ports?

**Troubleshooting**
* A USB device connected to a computer is not being recognized. Outline a basic troubleshooting process.
* A USB flash drive's transfer speeds seem much slower than expected. What factors could be causing this?

**Advanced/Emerging Concepts**
* Explain the concept of "Alternate Modes" in USB-C, and give examples of its use (e.g., DisplayPort).
* How does USB4 incorporate Thunderbolt technology? What are the benefits of this integration?
* Discuss potential limitations of relying solely on USB-C for all connectivity needs on a laptop.

**USB Protocols**
* Explain the difference between USB control transfers, bulk transfers, and interrupt transfers. When might each type be used? 
* How does USB handshaking ensure reliable data transmission between devices?
* Describe the concept of USB hubs and how they allow for connecting multiple devices to a single USB port. 

**USB Power Specifications**
* What is the typical bus power (voltage and current) provided by a standard USB 2.0 port? How does this differ with USB 3.0 and higher?
* Explain the purpose of dedicated charging ports on some computers, which often provide higher current than standard USB ports.
* How does USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) negotiate higher power delivery levels for compatible devices (e.g., laptops)?
* Discuss safety considerations related to using unapproved or low-quality USB chargers. 

**USB Transfer Speeds**
* Beyond the generational differences (USB 2.0, 3.0, etc.), what other factors can influence real-world USB transfer speeds? (e.g., cable quality, storage device limitations)
* How do USB overhead and protocol handshakes affect the effective data transfer rates experienced by users?
* You're transferring a large video file between a computer and an external SSD. Why might the actual transfer speed be slower than the maximum theoretical speed of the USB interface?
