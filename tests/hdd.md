    actuator arm, read/write head, spindle motor)

3.  Explain the difference between an HDD and a solid-state drive (SSD).

4.  Describe the concepts of storage capacity, data transfer rates
    (read/write speeds), and seek time.

5.  What is the purpose of disk formatting? Explain the difference
    between common file systems (FAT32, NTFS, exFAT).

6.  What does S.M.A.R.T. stand for, and how is it used in hard drive
    health monitoring?

## Part 2: Hard Disk Interfaces and Connectivity

1.  List the most common internal hard disk interfaces (SATA, IDE/PATA,
    SCSI).

2.  Describe the advantages and typical use cases of each interface.

3.  Explain the different types of external hard drive connections (USB,
    Thunderbolt, eSATA).

4.  What is a RAID array? Describe basic RAID levels (0, 1, 5).

## Part 3: Troubleshooting and Maintenance

1.  What are the common signs of a failing hard drive?

2.  How can you check the health and S.M.A.R.T. status of a hard drive?
    (List appropriate software tools)

3.  Explain the process of disk defragmentation and why it might be
    necessary.

4.  What is the purpose of a disk cleanup utility?

5.  What is the difference between a bad sector and a dead hard drive?

## Part 4: Other Storage Media

1.  Although largely obsolete, why is it important to have a basic
    understanding of floppy disks and their historical significance?

2.  What is a magnetic tape? What are common use cases for tape drives
    despite their slower access times?

3.  How do optical drives (CD, DVD, Blu-ray) work?

4.  Describe the advantages and disadvantages of cloud storage
    solutions.

## Part 5: Scenario-Based Questions

1.  A user reports their computer is running very slowly. What steps
    would you take to troubleshoot if you suspect hard drive issues?

2.  You need to set up a storage solution for a video editing
    workstation that requires fast speeds and large capacity. What type
    of hard drive configuration would you recommend?

3.  A user\'s computer won\'t boot, and you hear clicking noises from
    the hard drive. What is the likely issue, and how would you advise
    the user?

4.  A server needs a reliable and fault-tolerant storage solution. What
    RAID level would you suggest and why?

## Part 6: SSD Specific Questions

1.  What is the wear-leveling process in SSDs, and why is it important?

2.  How does TRIM command benefit SSD performance and longevity?

3.  List the different form factors for SSDs (2.5-inch, M.2, U.2, etc.)
    and their typical uses.

4.  Explain the concepts of over-provisioning in SSDs.

## Part 7: NVMe Specific Questions

1.  How does the NVMe protocol differ from AHCI, and what are the
    performance advantages?

2.  What is the role of the NVMe host controller?

3.  List different M.2 keying types for NVMe drives and their
    compatibility implications.

4.  Explain the impact of PCIe generation (e.g., PCIe 3.0 vs. PCIe 4.0)
    on NVMe drive performance.

## Part 8: Scenario-Based (SSD and NVMe)

1.  A graphic designer needs a storage upgrade for faster loading and
    saving of large projects. Would you recommend an SSD or an NVMe
    drive, and why?

2.  You\'re building a new database server that requires both high-speed
    storage and data redundancy. What kind of SSD/NVMe configuration
    would you suggest?

3.  A user\'s laptop has a single M.2 slot. They want to upgrade but are
    unsure if their laptop supports SATA or NVMe M.2 drives. How can
    they determine compatibility?

## Understanding Speed Units

1.  Explain the difference between a bit (b) and a byte (B).

2.  Convert the following:

    a.  2 Megabytes (MB) to Kilobytes (KB)

    b.  500 Kilobits per second (Kbps) to Megabits per second (Mbps)

3.  A user downloads a 500 MB file in 2 minutes. What is the approximate
    download speed in Mbps?

4.  Rank the following speed units from slowest to fastest: Mbps, Kbps,
    Gbps, Bps

## IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)

1.  What is the definition of IOPS?

2.  Why are IOPS important when considering hard drive or SSD
    performance?

3.  What kind of workloads typically benefit from high IOPS? (Give
    examples)

## Other Speed Parameters

1.  Define latency in the context of storage devices.

2.  How does latency differ from throughput?

3.  Explain the difference between sequential read/write speeds and
    random read/write speeds.

4.  A hard drive has a seek time of 10ms, what does this signify?

## Scenario-Based Speed parameters

1.  You are selecting a storage device for a web server that handles
    many small file requests simultaneously. Would you prioritize a
    drive with high sequential speeds or high IOPS? Explain.

2.  A user complains that their video editing software feels sluggish
    even though they have a fast internet connection. What
    storage-related factors might be contributing to this?
