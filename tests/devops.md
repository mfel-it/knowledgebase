## Devops

**DevOps Foundations**
* **Define DevOps:**  Provide your own definition of DevOps, going beyond just tools and automation.
* **Collaboration:** Describe specific ways DevOps fosters collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
* **Metrics:** What are some essential metrics to track DevOps success?  Explain why they are important.
* **"You Build It, You Run It":** Explain this principle and discuss its potential benefits and challenges. 
* **Explain CI/CD:** What is continuous integration/continuous delivery, and what key benefits does it offer?
* **Toolchain:** Describe a typical DevOps toolchain and the role each tool plays (e.g., version control, build automation, testing, deployment).
* **Challenge:**  Outline a common friction point between development and operations teams, and how DevOps practices can address it. 
* **The "Why" of DevOps:** What problems does DevOps aim to solve compared to traditional software development models?
* **CAMS Model:** Explain the core components of CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) and their importance in DevOps.
* **Benefits and Challenges:** List the top 3 benefits of adopting DevOps, and the top 3 challenges organizations might face during the transition.

**CI/CD Pipeline**
* **Pipeline Stages:**  Describe the typical stages of a CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy, etc.).
* **Continuous Integration:** Explain how continuous integration ensures code quality and collaboration.
* **Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment:** Differentiate between these two concepts, and when one might be favored over the other.

**Workflow & Tooling**
* **Version Control Branching:**  Which branching strategy would you use in a DevOps environment, and why? (e.g., Gitflow, trunk-based development)
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Explain IaC concepts and name two popular tools.
* **Test Automation:**  At what stages of the CI/CD pipeline is test automation most crucial, and what types of tests would you prioritize?
* **Containerization:** How does containerization (e.g., Docker) streamline development and deployment in a DevOps context?

**Scenario-Based**
* **Shifting Security Left:**  You need to implement better security earlier in the development process. Propose 2-3 specific changes to the current workflow.
* **Container Security:** You're deploying containerized applications. What unique security challenges does this introduce, and how would you mitigate them?
* **Audit Trail:** A regulatory audit is coming up. How will you demonstrate that changes to infrastructure are tracked, authorized, and reversible?  

**Problem-Solving & Scenarios**
* **Bottleneck:** Your team's deployment process has a major bottleneck. Describe how you'd troubleshoot to pinpoint the root cause.
* **Legacy Application:** You need to modernize a legacy application's deployment. What factors would you consider to make it more "DevOps-friendly"? 
* **Microservices:** Briefly outline the advantages and challenges of migrating a monolithic application to a microservices architecture from a DevOps perspective.

**Security Considerations**
* **Threat Modeling:** How would you approach threat modeling for a web application? What factors would you consider?
* **Vulnerability Management:**  Describe your process for identifying, prioritizing, and patching vulnerabilities in a production environment.
* **Defense in Depth:** Explain the concept of defense in depth and give examples of security controls at different layers.

**Audit Focus**
* **Compliance Frameworks:** Name common compliance frameworks relevant to DevOps (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS).  Choose one and discuss its key requirements.
* **Log Analysis:** What critical information should be logged for security and audit purposes in a CI/CD pipeline? 
* **Incident Response:** In the event of a security breach, what steps should be in your incident response plan from a DevOps perspective?

**Tools and Technologies**
* **Tool Categories:** Name essential categories of tools used in DevOps (e.g., version control, configuration management, container orchestration) and provide 1-2 examples for each category.
* **Cloud and DevOps:**  How does cloud computing change the way DevOps is implemented? 
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Describe how tools like Terraform or Ansible enable IaC practices.

**Culture Shift**
* **Breaking down Silos:** How does DevOps promote cross-functional team collaboration?
* **Feedback Loops:** Explain the importance of feedback loops in DevOps, and give an example of how to implement one.
* **Embracing Failure (Productively):**  How does DevOps change the way teams approach failure and experimentation?

**Containerization**
* **Beyond Packaging:** How do containers differ from virtual machines in terms of resource utilization and portability?
* **Image Creation**: Outline the key steps involved in creating a Docker image and explain the role of a Dockerfile.
* **Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Briefly describe the purpose of Kubernetes, and name two core Kubernetes objects.
* **Security Considerations:** What are some unique security concerns to be aware of when using containers in production?
* **Scenario: Microservices**: You're splitting a large application into microservices. How would containers simplify development and deployment in this scenario?

**Version Control Branching**
* **Gitflow vs. Trunk-Based:**  Compare and contrast Gitflow and Trunk-Based Development strategies. Discuss a scenario where each might be preferable.
* **Feature Branches:** Describe the workflow of creating a feature branch, integrating changes back into the main branch, and resolving potential merge conflicts.
* **Versioning Strategy:** You're developing a software product with major and minor releases. Outline a suitable versioning strategy (e.g., Semantic Versioning) and how it would map to your branching model.
* **Collaboration:** How does a well-defined branching strategy facilitate smooth collaboration in a team with multiple developers?

**Image Layering**
* **Layering Benefits:** Explain how Docker's image layering system improves efficiency in building and sharing images.
* **Best Practices:** What are some key practices to follow when creating Dockerfiles to optimize image size and layer efficiency?
* **Layer Inspection:** How would you use Docker commands to inspect the individual layers of an image and their contents?
* **Troubleshooting:**  You have an image that has grown excessively large. How would you troubleshoot to determine which layer(s) are contributing most to the size?
* **Optimization:**  Given a sample Dockerfile, suggest ways to refactor it to improve layering efficiency.
