## GPU

**Beginner**

* What is a GPU, and how does it differ from a CPU? (Focus on parallel processing vs. sequential)
* Name at least three real-world applications where GPUs are particularly useful. (Gaming, AI, scientific computing, video editing)
* What is the relationship between a GPU and graphics display on a computer? 
* When buying a GPU, what are two key specifications to consider? (Memory size, number of cores)

**Intermediate**

* Explain the concepts of CUDA cores and Tensor cores. What kind of tasks do they specialize in? (NVIDIA terminology)
* How does GPU memory bandwidth impact performance? (Bottlenecks in data transfer)
* What are the trade-offs between using a single powerful GPU vs. multiple GPUs in a system?
* Describe the role of GPU drivers. Why is it important to keep them updated? 

**Advanced**

* Outline the high-level architecture of a modern GPU. (Streaming multiprocessors, memory hierarchy)
* Discuss optimization techniques for GPU programming, such as memory coalescing and avoiding warp divergence. 
* What is GPGPU computing? How is it used in areas outside of traditional graphics rendering?
* Explain how GPUs are used to accelerate deep learning training and inference.

**Practical/Problem-Solving**

* You're building a computer for video editing. What factors should guide your GPU choice? (Software compatibility, resolution you work with)
* Your game consistently has low frame rates, even after reducing graphics settings.  What could be potential bottlenecks (including but not limited to the GPU)?
* You're considering using a cloud-based GPU instance for a machine learning project.  What factors help determine if this is cost-effective?

**GPU in 3D Modeling & Rendering**

* What specific tasks within 3D modeling does a GPU accelerate? (Viewport manipulation, mesh calculations, real-time previews, raytracing)
* How does a GPU's VRAM amount affect 3D workflows? (Scene complexity, texture size, large datasets)
* Explain the different rendering techniques (rasterization, ray tracing, path tracing) and how GPUs play a role in each.
* In rendering software, what is the difference between CPU and GPU rendering engines? When would you choose one over the other?
* How do GPUs enable real-time viewport performance in 3D modeling applications?  

**GPU in AI Applications**

* Why are GPUs well-suited for the parallel computations required in deep learning?
* How do GPUs accelerate both the training and inference phases of machine learning models?
* What are CUDA and cuDNN? How do they relate to GPU programming for AI (NVIDIA libraries for deep learning acceleration)
* Discuss the role of GPUs in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.
* How are GPUs utilized in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models?

**Additional Considerations**

* **Software Compatibility:**  What rendering engines or AI frameworks are optimized for your preferred GPU brand (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)?
* **Cost vs. Performance:** How do you balance the price of a GPU with the performance gains needed for your specific 3D modeling/rendering or AI workload?
* **Cloud-Based GPUs:** When do cloud-based solutions with access to powerful GPUs make sense for AI/3D modeling vs. a local workstation?
