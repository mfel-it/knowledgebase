## SMPS test

**Fundamentals**
* What is the primary function of an SMPS in a computer?
* List the main voltage rails (+12V, +5V, +3.3V, etc.) typically output by a computer SMPS.
* Explain the difference between an ATX and an SFX form factor SMPS in terms of their physical dimensions.
* Describe the basic AC to DC conversion process within an SMPS.

**Efficiency and Ratings**
* What does the 80 Plus certification indicate about an SMPS? Explain the different certification levels (e.g., Bronze, Gold, Platinum).
* How might a higher-efficiency SMPS benefit the user in terms of  power consumption and heat generation?

**Components and Terminology**
* Identify the following key components inside a typical SMPS: transformer, capacitors, rectifier, MOSFETs.
* What is the role of the PFC (Power Factor Correction) circuit in a modern SMPS?
* Explain the concept of modular vs. non-modular cabling in an SMPS.

**Troubleshooting**
* The computer completely fails to power on. What SMPS-related issues could you investigate?
* The system experiences random crashes or restarts, especially under load. How might the SMPS be a possible cause?
* You hear a high-pitched whining noise coming from the computer.  Discuss potential components that could be the source, including the SMPS.

**Choosing an SMPS**
* You're building a high-end gaming PC with a powerful graphics card.  What key factors would you prioritize when selecting an SMPS?
* A user needs an SMPS for a  compact, space-efficient computer build. What considerations are important in this scenario?

**Advanced (Optional)**
* Describe the different topologies used in SMPS designs (e.g., flyback, two-transistor forward).
* Explain the concept of over-current protection (OCP) and other safety features found in modern SMPS units.
* Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of LLC resonant converter topologies in high-efficiency SMPS designs.
* Explain how interleaving multiple phases in an SMPS can reduce output ripple and improve overall stability.
* What are the trade-offs between active and passive Power Factor Correction (PFC) circuits?
* How might the design of an SMPS for a server environment differ from one designed for a consumer gaming PC?

Absolutely! Let's do a deeper dive into fundamentals, advanced concepts, and even touch on SMPS repair:

**Fundamentals (Deeper)**
* Explain the difference between a continuous mode and discontinuous mode SMPS topology.
* Describe how the duty cycle of the MOSFET switching in an SMPS influences the output voltage.
* What are some common failure modes of electrolytic capacitors in an SMPS, and how do they manifest?
* Beyond the main voltage rails, describe some less common rails that may be present in an SMPS (e.g., -12V, +5VSB).

**SMPS Repair (Cautionary)**
* **Emphasize Safety:** Highlight the dangers of working with high-voltage capacitors within a powered-off SMPS. Outline essential safety procedures.
* **Visual Inspection:** What signs of damage should you look for during an initial inspection of a potentially faulty SMPS (e.g., bulging capacitors, burnt components, signs of leakage)?
* **Multimeter Usage:**  Describe how to use a multimeter to check fuses, diodes, and MOSFETs within an SMPS circuit.
* **Specialized Tools:** Briefly mention tools beyond a multimeter that might be helpful for in-depth SMPS repair (e.g., ESR meter, oscilloscope).
