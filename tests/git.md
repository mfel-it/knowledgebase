## Git test

**Concepts**
* Explain Git in simple terms. What kind of problems does it help solve?
* Describe the difference between a local repository and a remote repository.
* What is the purpose of "staging" changes in Git?
* Explain the basic workflow of making changes, committing them, and optionally pushing them to a remote repository.
* What is a Git branch, and why are branches useful?

**Git Commands**
* **Initializing a repository:**  How would you create a new local Git repository in a directory?
* **Staging and Committing:** 
    * How do you stage all changes in your working directory?
    * How do you commit staged changes with a commit message?
* **Checking Status:**  What command shows the status of your current branch, including staged and unstaged changes?
* **Branching**
    * How do you list all existing branches in your repository?
    * How do you create a new branch and switch to it?
* **Basic History:**  How would you view a log of recent commits in your repository? 

**Scenario-Based**
* You made accidental changes to a file. How could you use Git to revert those changes and go back to the last commit?
* You've been working on a new feature in a separate branch.  Outline the steps on how to merge this completed feature into your main branch.
